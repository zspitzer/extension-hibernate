# Lucee Hibernate Extension (ORM)

[![Java CI](https://github.com/lucee/extension-hibernate/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?branch=7.0)](https://github.com/lucee/extension-hibernate/actions/workflows/main.yml)

Built using [Hibernate ORM 7.3.2](https://hibernate.org/orm/) on Java 21.

> **Heads up:** this is the `7.0` migration branch (Hibernate 7.3.2). The
> shipping LTS is the `5.6` branch (Hibernate 5.6, Lucee 6.2.5.48+). See
> [History](#history) below.

Install via Lucee Admin, or pin in your environment:

```bash
# Maven coordinates, auto-updates to latest snapshot
LUCEE_EXTENSIONS=org.lucee:hibernate-extension:7.3.2.0-SNAPSHOT
```

See [Lucee Compatibility](#lucee-compatibility) for minimum supported versions.

## History

- **Hibernate 7.3 (branch `7.0`, this branch)** — major upgrade. Hibernate 7 completes the **`javax.persistence` → `jakarta.persistence`** namespace migration (Jakarta Persistence 3.2), requires Java 21, and reshapes large parts of the API surface. Criteria rewritten to JPA `CriteriaBuilder`, schema work moved to `SchemaManager`, EHCache dropped in favour of Caffeine/JCache, dialect aliases collapsed to version-agnostic families, HQL parser is now strict on identifier casing, and several `SessionFactory` metadata APIs were removed (the extension restores a compat shim for cborm/ColdBox/Slatwall). **Not backwards-compatible** — see [BREAKING-CHANGES.md](BREAKING-CHANGES.md). Tracked under [LDEV-6292](https://luceeserver.atlassian.net/browse/LDEV-6292).
- **Hibernate 5.6 (branch `5.6`, current LTS)** — Lucee resumed active development, merging the Ortus work and upgrading 5.4 → 5.6 with native logging, transaction integration, and expanded test coverage. Bug fixes and minor features land here.
- **Ortus fork** — Ortus Solutions forked the extension, completed the Hibernate 5.4 upgrade, and maintained it.
- **Lucee 5.4 (beta)** — Lucee began upgrading to Hibernate 5.4 but it only reached beta.
- **Extension extraction** — ORM was pulled out of Lucee core into a standalone extension.
- **Lucee core (Hibernate 3.5)** — ORM was originally built into Lucee core.

> Hibernate 7.3 deleted a lot of API surface that CFML libraries depend on. Where Lucee can transparently keep your code working, we will (`SessionFactory` metadata methods, `Session` legacy methods via opt-in shim CFCs). Where Hibernate's behaviour itself changed, we document it in [BREAKING-CHANGES.md](BREAKING-CHANGES.md) and you'll need to adapt.

## Lucee Compatibility

| Lucee line | Minimum patch |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| 6.2        | 6.2.7.11      |
| 7.0        | 7.0.4.27      |
| 7.1        | 7.1.0.108     |

These are the patches that contain the [LDEV-6291](https://luceeserver.atlassian.net/browse/LDEV-6291) fix for `DatasourceConnectionImpl.prepareStatement`, which Hibernate 7.3's strict JDBC holdability check trips on. The extension declares `luceeCoreVersion: 6.2.7.11` in `build.properties`.

Earlier Lucee patches are not supported on this branch — use the `5.6` branch of the extension instead.
